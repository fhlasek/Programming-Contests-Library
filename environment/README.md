# Programming Contest Environment by Filip Hlasek

The environment consists of three parts:

* `bashrc` config file which defines basic terminal colors and other settings
* `template.cpp` template which includes useful STL libraries and defines a few macros
* `vimrc` contains additional vim settings for my main [.vim](https://github/fhlasek/.vim) config

## Installation

    ./install.sh
